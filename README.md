# Technical Assessment - OneST
This repository contains my submission for the Technical Assessment from ST Engineering.

The assessment requires creating 2 services -
Service 1: Validation of Unique entity number (UEN) of company,
Service 2: Weather Forecast of Singapore

The codes for the 2 services are inside the corresponding folders - Service 1, Service 2. 

# Running the services
I have included 2 ways of running the services - either executing the services mannually on Eclipse IDE or executing the JAR file. 
Therefore, each folder (Service 1 and Service 2) contains an Archive File (.zip) and a Runnable JAR File (.jar) for these purposes. 


**Method 1: Executing the services in Eclipse IDE**

Importing the file: File > Import > General > Existing Projects into Workspace > Select archive file > (Select Archive File) > Finish

Executing the file: (Select the project) > Run <img width="18" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54829920/170646988-b4c58d9a-e8c9-415d-8c63-ac26c024009a.png">

*Note: The Archive files are located inside the "Archive File (.zip)" folder for each service.*

**Method 2: Executing the JAR File**

Executing the file: Launch the (.jar) file

*Note: The JAR files are located inside the "Runnable JAR File (.jar)" folder for each service. Ensure that Java is installed on computer.*
